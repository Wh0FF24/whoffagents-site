Title: I built an AI wingman for when you're stuck on what to text back [BYU Launch]

Body:
---
Honest question: How many times have you stared at a text for 20 minutes trying to come up with the perfect response?

I'm a BYU student (CS major) and I kept seeing friends overthink every single message. So I built **The Wingman** - an AI tool that analyzes your conversation screenshots and suggests 3 response options based on your style (Confident, Playful, or Thoughtful).

**How it works:**
1. Screenshot your conversation
2. Upload it
3. Get instant response suggestions that match your voice

It's $5 per analysis (less than a date), and to celebrate launch week I'm offering 50% off with code LAUNCH50.

Try it: [wingman.whoffagents.com](https://wingman.whoffagents.com)

Would love feedback from fellow BYU students. What features would make this more useful?

🧵 I just launched The Wingman - an AI dating assistant for when you're stuck on what to text back.

Here's why it exists:

1/ Dating anxiety is real. 73% of people admit to overthinking text responses. 

I watched friends spend 20+ minutes crafting a single reply, only to get ghosted anyway.

2/ Most dating advice is generic. "Be yourself" - okay, but HOW?

The Wingman analyzes YOUR specific conversation and suggests responses that match your authentic voice.

3/ It works like this:
📸 Screenshot your convo
⬆️ Upload to wingman.whoffagents.com
🤖 Get 3 AI-crafted responses
💬 Choose your style (Confident/Playful/Thoughtful)

4/ Privacy-first: Your screenshots aren't stored. Analysis happens in real-time, then deleted.

$5 per use. Less than a coffee date. 50% off launch week with LAUNCH50.

5/ Built by BYU students, for BYU students (but works anywhere).

Feedback welcome. What features would make this better?
